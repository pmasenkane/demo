 And what, then, is belief? It is the demi-cadence 
     which closes a musical phrase in the symphony of our 
     intellectual life.  We have seen that it has just 
     three properties: First, it is something that we are
     aware of; second, it appeases the irritation of doubt; 
     and, third, it involves the establishment in our 
     nature of a rule of action, or, say for short, a 
     habit.
